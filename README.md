This project involves building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions. Using a dataset of over 6 million records, the model aims to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent based on key features like transaction type, amount, and account balances. The analysis reveals that most frauds occur during TRANSFER and CASH_OUT transactions, with larger transaction amounts being a significant factor. By identifying these patterns, the model helps financial institutions flag suspicious activities and reduce fraudulent transactions. The project includes data preprocessing, model development, evaluation using cross-validation, and feature importance analysis.
